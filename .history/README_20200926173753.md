## Built with




-  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - This project (X Check App) was bootstrapped with Create React App.

-  [antd](http://getbootstrap.com/) -  React UI library antd that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

-  [react](https://babeljs.io/) - Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

-  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - At its core, **webpack** is a _static module bundler_ for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a [dependency graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/) which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more _bundles_.

-  [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. We take this compatibility seriously, so that you can seamlessly use any available CSS libraries.

-  [EsLint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
