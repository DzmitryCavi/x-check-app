-  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - This project (X Check App) was bootstrapped with Create React App.

-  [Antd](http://getbootstrap.com/) -  React UI library antd that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

-  [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

-  [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - A Predictable State Container for JS Apps.

-  [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) - is a library that aims to make application side effects (i.e. asynchronous things like data fetching and impure things like accessing the browser cache) easier to manage, more efficient to execute, easy to test, and better at handling failures.

-  [EsLint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.
