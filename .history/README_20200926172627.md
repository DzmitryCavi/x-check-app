## Built with




-  [API](https://afternoon-falls-25894.herokuapp.com/doc/#/) - Words, Translate, SingIn/Up, Statistic.

-  [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) - Extensive list of components and Bundled Javascript plugins.

-  [Babeljs](https://babeljs.io/) - Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

  -  [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - At its core, **webpack** is a _static module bundler_ for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a [dependency graph](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/dependency-graph/) which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more _bundles_.

  -  [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS. We take this compatibility seriously, so that you can seamlessly use any available CSS libraries.

  -  [EsLint](https://eslint.org/) - ESLint is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs.

## To-do

- Add more games.

- Page "Statistics ".
